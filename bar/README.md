- Given a text file that contains one integer per line, write a function that sums up the integers and prints the result and the number of integers found in the file. For the following problems, please consider the efficiency and complexity of your solutions, in particular consider how your solution would scale with a very large data set.
- Find the largest integer value in an array of integers.
